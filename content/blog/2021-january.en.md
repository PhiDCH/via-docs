**VIA - Vietnam Autonomous**   is an open-source project initiated by [MakerHanoi](https://www.facebook.com/makerhanoi) to create an open platform for autonomous vehicles. We aim to help students, makers, and hobbyists to build their own 3D printed cars as the platforms for studying AI. This project has 4 major part:

- **VIA Bot:** Open source self-driving model car. Including 3D printed car shell and chassis, electric board as well as algorithm to help detecting route, traffic sign and control the vehicle. The hadware of this model car was designed for financial optimization so that everyone can access to it.
- **VIA Dataset:** Open data source for autonomous. Collecting data from each and every prototype, our community will contribute to create many data sets to help developing self-driving car. Data was and will always be the key factor when it comes to developing advanced algorithm and model using for AI. That's why this data source would become a valuable resources for every AI fresher, specially in autonomous field .
- **VIA Community:** Building community project on VIA Bot platform. VIA Community would also focus on making documents and open courses so that anyone can get access to sudying on technology, programming, robotics and artificial intelligent.
- **VIA Simulator:** Beside 3D printed module, VIA also provides a autonomous simutalor that focus on low capacity, speed, simple designing to run maps for self-driving cars. By using this simulator, we can experiment with any algorithm before put into practice.

## VIA is an open source project!

You can help us to build VIA as a module designer, a code writer, a document maker, or even a debaters. We appreciate your every part. For further detail, please contact us at [MakerHanoi](https://www.facebook.com/makerhanoi)
