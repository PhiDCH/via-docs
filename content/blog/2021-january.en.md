**VIA - Vietnam Autonomous**   is an open-source project initiated by [MakerHanoi](https://www.facebook.com/makerhanoi)  to create an open platform for autonomous vehicles. We aim to help students, makers, and hobbyists to build their own 3D printed cars as the platforms for studying AI. This project has four major parts:

- **VIA Bot:** Open source self-driving model car, including 3D printed car chassis, PCB boards as well as the algorithms for lane line detection, traffic sign detection, and vehicle control. The hardware of this model car was designed for financial optimization so that everyone can access it.
- **VIA Dataset:** Open datasets for self-driving development. By collecting data from prototypes, our community will contribute to creating many datasets for developing self-driving cars. Data was and will always be a key factor when it comes to AI model development. Thatâ€™s why this data source would become a valuable resource for every AI fresher, especially in the autonomous field.
- **VIA Community:** Building community project on VIA Bot platform. VIA Community would also focus on making documents and open courses so that anyone can get access to studying technology, programming, robotics, and artificial intelligence.
- **VIA Simulator:** Besides the 3D printed physical car, VIA also provides a self-driving simulator that focuses on lightweight and ease of use. By using this simulator, we can experiment with any algorithm before put into practice.

## VIA is an open source project!

You can help us to build VIA as a module designer, a code writer, a document maker, or even a debater. We appreciate your every part. For further detail, please contact us at [MakerHanoi](https://www.facebook.com/makerhanoi)
